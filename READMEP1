/* Code written by Robert Gross */


To compile code, in command line simply call:

make

Once the program has compiled it can be run by calling the following where {file} is the name of the textfile the user is testing the interpreter with:

./main {file}

Ideas for the approach were taken from the assignment sheet, utilized, and built upon in the sexp.h file

Ideas for the evaluation approach were taken from lecture notes
